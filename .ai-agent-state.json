  "planContent": "# Plan: Clean Up Agents - Keep Only Execute\n\n## Summary\nRemove all 6 specialized agents (bugfix, feature, refactor, builder, migrator, scaffold) since the execute agent + /harness skill workflow replaces them. Going forward, all task execution will use Claude Code plan mode → /harness skill → execute agent.\n\n---\n\n## Step 1: Delete Agent Directories\n\nRemove these 6 directories entirely:\n- `src/agents/bugfix/`\n- `src/agents/feature/`\n- `src/agents/refactor/`\n- `src/agents/builder/`\n- `src/agents/migrator/`\n- `src/agents/scaffold/`\n\n**Keep:** `src/agents/execute/`\n\n---\n\n## Step 2: Update `src/agents/index.ts`\n\nRemove all exports except execute:\n\n```typescript\n/**\n * AI Agents - Execute Agent\n */\nexport { runExecute, type ExecuteOptions } from \"./execute\";\n```\n\n---\n\n## Step 3: Update `src/core/state.ts`\n\n### Remove Types\n- `BuilderState`, `FeatureTest`, `FeatureCategory`\n- `MigratorState`, `MigrationFile`, `MigrationFileStatus`\n- `ScaffoldState`, `ScaffoldTask`, `ScaffoldTaskStatus`\n- `BugfixState`\n- `FeatureState`\n- `RefactorState`, `RefactorFocus`\n\n### Update `AgentType`\n```typescript\nexport type AgentType = \"execute\";\n```\n\n### Update `ProjectState` union\n```typescript\nexport type ProjectState = ExecuteState;\n```\n\n### Keep (used by execute)\n- `BaseState`\n- `ExecuteState`, `ExecutionPermissions`, `ExecutionConfig`\n- `AgentTask`, `AgentTaskStatus` (aliased from existing types)\n- Core functions: `loadState`, `saveState`, `hasExistingState`, `detectStateType`\n- Execute-specific: `loadExecuteTasks`, `saveExecuteTasks`, `getExecuteTasksPath`, `syncExecuteTasksFromFile`\n- Progress: `appendProgress`, `readProgress`, `getProgressFilePath`\n- Session: `incrementSession`, `markInitialized`\n- Completion: `isComplete` (simplified)\n- Progress display: `printProgress`, `printExecuteProgress`\n\n### Remove\n- All builder/migrator/scaffold/bugfix/feature/refactor specific functions\n- File path helpers for removed agents\n- Load/save functions for removed agents\n- Progress functions for removed agents\n\n---\n\n## Step 4: Update `src/cli.ts`\n\n### Remove Commands\n- `bugfix` command (lines 63-117)\n- `feature` command (lines 119-172)\n- `refactor` command (lines 174-217)\n- `build` command (lines 219-271)\n- `migrate` command (lines 273-314)\n- `scaffold` command (lines 316-379)\n- `resume` command (lines 417-511) - replaced by `execute --resume`\n\n### Keep Commands\n- `execute` (lines 385-411)\n- `status` (lines 517-597) - simplify to only handle execute state\n\n### Update Imports\nRemove unused imports:\n```typescript\n// Remove these:\nimport { runBugFix } from \"./agents/bugfix\";\nimport { runFeature } from \"./agents/feature\";\nimport { runRefactor } from \"./agents/refactor\";\nimport { runBuilder } from \"./agents/builder\";\nimport { runMigrator } from \"./agents/migrator\";\nimport { runScaffold } from \"./agents/scaffold\";\n```\n\n### Update Help Text\nSimplify to only show execute command usage.\n\n---\n\n## Step 5: Update `src/core/permissions.ts`\n\nThis file imports `AgentType` from state, so it will update automatically. However, simplify the `getAllowedCommands` function since only execute type exists.\n\n---\n\n## Step 6: Update `src/core/longrunning.ts`\n\nReview imports - it imports `BuilderState`, `MigratorState`, `ScaffoldState` from state. Remove unused imports. The core loop logic should still work for execute agent.\n\n---\n\n## Step 7: Update `README.md`\n\nRewrite to document the new workflow:\n1. Create plan in Claude Code plan mode\n2. Run `/harness` skill to generate execution config\n3. Run `mizu execute <config.json>` to execute\n\n---\n\n## Execution Order\n\n1. Delete 6 agent directories\n2. Update `src/agents/index.ts`\n3. Update `src/core/state.ts` - remove types and functions\n4. Update `src/cli.ts` - remove commands and imports\n5. Update `src/core/permissions.ts` - simplify\n6. Update `src/core/longrunning.ts` - remove unused imports\n7. Update `README.md` - document new workflow\n8. Run `npm run build` / `npx tsc --noEmit` - verify compilation\n9. Test `mizu execute --help`\n\n---\n\n## Verification\n\n1. **TypeScript builds:** `npx tsc --noEmit`\n2. **Execute works:** `mizu execute --help`\n3. **No orphans:** Search for any remaining references to removed agents\n4. **Docs accurate:** README matches actual CLI commands\n",

Now I need to work on task-005: updating `src/core/permissions.ts` to simplify it since only the execute type exists. Let me first read the file to understand its structure:Good! I can see the file structure. The `getAllowedCommands` function (lines 62-69) can be simplified since `AgentType` is now only `\"execute\"`. The function currently doesn't do any type-specific logic anyway - it just adds DEV_COMMANDS to all agent types. I can simplify this function and potentially the documentation. Let me update the file:Good! Now let me also update the file header comment to reflect that this is specifically for the execute agent:Perfect! Now let me verify the file looks correct by reading the key sections:Excellent! The function is now simplified and the comment is updated.

Now I need to work on task-006: updating `src/core/longrunning.ts` to remove unused imports. Let me first read the file to understand its structure:Perfect! I can see that the file imports `BuilderState`, `MigratorState`, and `ScaffoldState` on lines 16-21, and they're used in the `printLongRunningCompletion` function (lines 388-407). Since these types no longer exist in state.ts, I need to remove these imports and simplify the completion function. Let me update the file:Good!
