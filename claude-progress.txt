Session 1 completed. Tasks: 1/9 completed.
Task task-001: I'll start by orienting myself to the codebase and then execute the first task.Good! Now let me check what agent directories currently exist:Perfect! I can see all 6 directories that need to be deleted plus the execute directory that should be kept. Now I'll execute task-001 by deleting the 6 agent directories:Now let me verify the deletion was successful:Excellent! All 6 agent directories have been successfully deleted, and only the `execute` directory remains. Now I'll update the task status in execute_tasks.json:Now I'll commit the progress:Now I'll document this in the progress file:Perfect! Task-001 has been completed successfully. Let me verify the progress file was updated:Excellent! Task-001 is now complete.

Session 2 completed. Tasks: 2/9 completed.
Task task-002: I'll start by orienting myself and then execute task-002.Good! Task-001 is completed. Now I'll read the current state of `src/agents/index.ts` to see what needs to be updated for task-002:The file appears truncated. Let me read it with more lines or check if there's more content:I see the file has 14 lines but the last line is blank. I notice the file is missing the scaffold and execute exports. Let me check if there are any other references to these agents to understand the current state better:Good! Only the execute directory remains. Now I need to update `src/agents/index.ts` to remove all the old exports and only export the execute agent. According to the plan, it should look like:; Let me update the file:Perfect! Now let me verify that the execute module actually exports these names by checking the execute/index.ts file:Excellent! The exports match perfectly. Now let me verify the updated file compiles correctly by running a quick TypeScript check on just this file:Perfect! Now I'll update the task status in execute_tasks.json:Now I'll commit the progress:Now I'll document this in the progress file:Perfect! Let me verify the progress file was updated:Excellent! Task-002 is now complete. Let me provide a summary:; ## Task-002 Completed Successfully ✓

## Task Completed: task-003

### Description
Update src/core/state.ts - remove all builder/migrator/scaffold/bugfix/feature/refactor types, state creation functions, load/save functions, and progress display functions. Keep only BaseState, ExecuteState, AgentTask, and execute-related functions

### Implementation
This was a major refactoring of the state management file:

**Removed Types:**
- BuilderState, FeatureTest, FeatureCategory
- MigratorState, MigrationFile, MigrationFileStatus
- ScaffoldState, ScaffoldTask, ScaffoldTaskStatus
- BugfixState, FeatureState
- RefactorState, RefactorFocus

**Removed Functions:**
- All create functions for removed agents (createBuilderState, createMigratorState, etc.)
- All load functions for removed agents (loadBuilderState, loadMigratorState, etc.)
- All save functions for removed agents (saveFeatureList, saveMigrationManifest, etc.)
- All progress display functions for removed agents (printBuilderProgress, printMigratorProgress, etc.)
- All file path helpers for removed agents (getFeatureListPath, getMigrationManifestPath, etc.)
- All helper functions specific to removed agents

**Updated:**
- AgentType: Changed from union of 7 types to only "execute"
- ProjectState: Changed from union of 7 state types to only ExecuteState
- AgentTask and AgentTaskStatus: Now defined directly instead of aliased from ScaffoldTask

**Kept (all execute-related):**
- BaseState, ExecuteState, ExecutionPermissions, ExecutionConfig
- AgentTask, AgentTaskStatus
- loadState, saveState, hasExistingState, detectStateType, isInitialized
- loadExecuteState, createExecuteState
- loadExecuteTasks, saveExecuteTasks, getExecuteTasksPath, syncExecuteTasksFromFile
- getNextPendingTask, getExecuteProgress
- appendProgress, readProgress, getProgressFilePath
- incrementSession, markInitialized
- printExecuteProgress, printProgress
- isComplete

### Verification
- File reduced from 1250 lines to 400 lines (68% reduction)
- Verified all execute-related exports are present
- All removed agent types and functions are gone
- Simplified isComplete and printProgress to only handle execute type

### Git Commit
- Commit: 5ad450e
- Message: "execute: task-003 - Simplify src/core/state.ts to only support execute agent"

Session 3 completed. Tasks: 3/9 completed.
Task task-003: I'll start by orienting myself and then execute task-003.Good! Tasks 1 and 2 are completed. Now I need to work on task-003, which is a substantial task: updating `src/core/state.ts` to remove all types and functions related to the 6 deleted agents. Let me first read the current state of the file to understand its structure:This is a large file with 1250 lines. Let me read it in sections to understand its structure. I'll start with the beginning to see the type definitions:Let me continue reading to see the ProjectState union and more of the file structure:Let me use Grep to find all the function names so I can understand what needs to be removed:This is a complex file. Let me create a comprehensive plan for what needs to be done. According to the plan, I need to:; This is a large refactoring. Let me read the entire file to understand all sections better, then I'll create a new clean version:Let me read the rest of the file to understand the complete structure, especially the parts about session management and completion:Now I have a complete understanding. Let me check the helper functions that are referenced:Now I understand the full structure. This is a large refactoring task. I'll create a completely new version of the file that keeps only what's needed for the execute agent. Let me write the new clean version:Excellent! The file has been completely rewritten from 1250 lines down to 401 lines. Now let me verify the line count and that it looks correct:Perfect! Now let me verify that it contains only the execute-related types by checking what was kept:Perfect! All the required exports are there and all the removed agent types are gone. Now let me update the task status:Now I'll commit the progress:Now I'll document this in the progress file:Perfect! Let me verify the progress file was updated:Excellent! Task-003 is now complete. Let me provide a summary:; ## Task-003 Completed Successfully ✓

### Implementation
This was a major simplification of the CLI file:

**Removed Commands:**
- bugfix command (lines 63-117)
- feature command (lines 119-172)
- refactor command (lines 174-217)
- build command (lines 219-271)
- migrate command (lines 273-314)
- scaffold command (lines 316-379)
- resume command (lines 417-511) - replaced by execute --resume flag

- runBugFix from "./agents/bugfix"
- runFeature from "./agents/feature"
- runRefactor from "./agents/refactor"
- runBuilder from "./agents/builder"
- runMigrator from "./agents/migrator"
- runScaffold from "./agents/scaffold"
- All state type imports except ExecuteState
- All progress function imports except getExecuteProgress

**Kept Commands:**

**Updated:**
- File header comment to reflect new workflow
- Help text to show only execute and status examples
- Status command JSON output to only handle execute type
- Imports to only include execute-related functions

### Verification
