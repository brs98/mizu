### Verification

Session 2 completed. Tasks: 2/9 completed.
Task task-002: I'll start by orienting myself and then execute task-002.Good! Task-001 is completed. Now I'll read the current state of `src/agents/index.ts` to see what needs to be updated for task-002:The file appears truncated. Let me read it with more lines or check if there's more content:I see the file has 14 lines but the last line is blank. I notice the file is missing the scaffold and execute exports. Let me check if there are any other references to these agents to understand the current state better:Good! Only the execute directory remains. Now I need to update `src/agents/index.ts` to remove all the old exports and only export the execute agent. According to the plan, it should look like:; Let me update the file:Perfect! Now let me verify that the execute module actually exports these names by checking the execute/index.ts file:Excellent! The exports match perfectly. Now let me verify the updated file compiles correctly by running a quick TypeScript check on just this file:Perfect! Now I'll update the task status in execute_tasks.json:Now I'll commit the progress:Now I'll document this in the progress file:Perfect! Let me verify the progress file was updated:Excellent! Task-002 is now complete. Let me provide a summary:; ## Task-002 Completed Successfully ✓
